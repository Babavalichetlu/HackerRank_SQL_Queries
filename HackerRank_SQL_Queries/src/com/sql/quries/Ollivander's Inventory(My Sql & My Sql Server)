/*
Harry Potter and his friends are at Ollivander's with Ron, finally replacing Charlie's old broken wand.
Hermione decides the best way to choose is by determining the minimum number of gold galleons needed to 
buy each non-evil wand of high power and age. Write a query to print the id, age, coins_needed, and power
of the wands that Ron's interested in, sorted in order of descending power. If more than one wand has 
same power, sort the result in order of descending age.

Input Format
-------------
The following tables contain data on the wands in Ollivander's inventory:
Wands: The id is the id of the wand, code is the code of the wand, coins_needed is the total number of gold galleons needed to buy the wand, and power denotes the quality of the wand (the higher the power, the better the wand is).
*/

Using My Sql Server
---------------------
SELECT id, age, coins_needed, power
FROM 
(
    SELECT W.id, WP.age, W.coins_needed, W.power,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER 
        (
            PARTITION BY W.code,W.power  
            ORDER BY W.coins_needed, W.power DESC
        ) AS RowNumber
    FROM Wands W WITH (NOLOCK)
    INNER JOIN Wands_Property WP WITH (NOLOCK) ON W.code = WP.code
    WHERE WP.is_evil = 0
)
AS Wand_Data
WHERE RowNumber = 1
ORDER BY power DESC, age DESC;

Using My SQl:
--------------
SELECT W.id, P.age, W.coins_needed, W.power
FROM WANDS AS W
    INNER JOIN WANDS_PROPERTY AS P ON W.code = P.code
WHERE P.is_evil = 0 AND W.coins_needed = 
    (SELECT MIN(coins_needed)
     FROM WANDS AS W1
        INNER JOIN WANDS_PROPERTY AS P1 ON W1.code = P1.code
     WHERE W1.power = W.power AND P1.age = P.age)
ORDER BY W.power DESC, P.age DESC
